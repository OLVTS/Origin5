# Telegram Bot for Post Management

## Overview

This is a Telegram bot application for managing posts with advanced features including role-based access control, analytics, and template-based post creation. The bot provides user management, post creation and editing capabilities, administrative functions, and built-in analytics tracking.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Python-based Telegram bot using `python-telegram-bot` library
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM for data persistence
- **Configuration**: Environment-based configuration using `python-dotenv`
- **Architecture Pattern**: Service-oriented architecture with clear separation of concerns

### Database Architecture
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy with declarative base models
- **Connection Management**: Connection pooling with configurable pool size and overflow
- **Migration Strategy**: Custom migration scripts in `/migrations` directory
- **Schema Design**: Relational design with proper foreign key relationships

## Key Components

### 1. Models (`models.py`)
- **User Model**: Stores user information, admin status, and activity tracking
- **Post Model**: Manages posts with numbering, templates, and publication status
- **UserActivity Model**: Tracks user interactions for analytics
- **Analytics Model**: Stores aggregated metrics and statistics
- **PostTemplate Model**: Manages reusable post templates

### 2. Services Layer
- **UserService**: Handles user creation, updates, and role management
- **PostService**: Manages post CRUD operations and numbering
- **AnalyticsService**: Tracks user activities and generates metrics

### 3. Handlers
- **Start Handler**: Welcome messages and user onboarding
- **Posts Handler**: Post creation, editing, and management
- **Admin Handler**: Administrative functions and user management
- **Analytics Handler**: Statistics and reporting features

### 4. Utilities
- **Decorators**: Role-based access control (`@admin_required`)
- **Keyboards**: Reusable inline keyboard layouts
- **Templates**: Predefined post templates (news, articles, announcements, etc.)

## Data Flow

### User Registration Flow
1. User sends `/start` command
2. Bot creates or updates user record in database
3. User activity is logged for analytics
4. Welcome message with main menu is displayed

### Post Creation Flow
1. User selects post template from available options
2. Bot guides user through template-specific fields
3. Post is created with auto-incrementing post number
4. Post can be published or saved as draft
5. Activity is tracked for analytics

### Admin Functions Flow
1. Admin commands are protected by `@admin_required` decorator
2. Admin can manage users, moderate posts, and view analytics
3. Advanced analytics and export functions are available
4. User management includes role assignment and blocking

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **python-telegram-bot**: Telegram Bot API wrapper
- **SQLAlchemy**: Database ORM and connection management
- **psycopg2**: PostgreSQL database adapter
- **python-dotenv**: Environment variable management

### Database Requirements
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database for data persistence
- **Connection Pooling**: Configured for production workloads
- **Environment Variables**: Database connection via environment configuration

## Deployment Strategy

### Configuration Management
- Environment-based configuration through `.env` files
- Separate settings for development and production
- Database connection strings and bot tokens via environment variables

### Database Setup
- Automatic database initialization on first run
- Migration scripts for schema updates
- Connection pooling for scalability
- Health checks and reconnection logic

### Production Considerations
- Logging configuration for monitoring
- Error handling and graceful degradation
- Connection pool sizing for concurrent users
- Analytics data retention policies

### Key Features
- **Role-Based Access**: Admin and regular user roles with different permissions
- **Template System**: Predefined templates for different types of posts
- **Analytics Tracking**: Built-in user activity and engagement tracking
- **Post Management**: Full CRUD operations with version control
- **Export Functionality**: Data export capabilities for administrators
- **Moderation Tools**: Admin approval workflow for posts

The application follows a clean architecture pattern with clear separation between handlers, services, and data models, making it maintainable and extensible for future features.
